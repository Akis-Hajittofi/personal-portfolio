Then, I self-taught myself TypeScript and MySQL, choosing this project as a learning playground, realizing the potential with paginated leaderboards and user accounts. To meet industry standards and challenge myself, I hosted the MySQL database on AWS EC2. Tackling the AWS ecosystem proved to be a significant challenge, involving many configurations but ultimately, incredibly rewarding and a key learning experience.`}

The Sign In / Sign Up form is conveniently provided by Clerk's prebuilt components, and once the sign up or sign in is complete, the user is taken to the relevant URL.`}

If the user is logged in, the score is automatically submitted if their score is higher than their top score which is checked in the controller of my Express application by fist sending an SQL command to check if the user's new score is higher than the top score which if this passes, the database is queried again to update the score.`}

      <div className="w-full text-xl font-light whitespace-pre-line">
        {`As a frontend developer on a four-person agile team, I played a key role in building Yuni Connect, a recruitment platform aimed at empowering university graduates with their job search. The idea behind this platform is to solve the common problem that graduates face: Uncertainty upon graduation or even whilst in studies, with what's the best steps to take and how to prepare well. Collaborating with the backend team that's using Python and Postgres has enabled me to deepen my understanding of data-fetching and caching methodologies, through the use of RTK Query, as well as broader data structures.

One of my key contributions is an intuitive drag & drop board for easy application tracking, making use of the React DnD library. This itself proved very challenging because I faced a lot of problems with updating the state correctly and synchronising the changes in the database. This happened because the items had positional index which was used to send to the database to save the order of the items. The algorithm was incorrectly updating the positional index, which on page reload will have a different order. Thus, the solution was to fix the for loop which was responsible for updating the positional index.`}

      "Maze game with 3d graphics made using React Three Fiber, featuring enemies, shooting, scores etc.",
    description: `Third-person maze game with 3d graphics featuring featuring moving enemies, HP, coins and a shooting weapon. The aim of the game is to find your way out of the maze without getting killed. The initial idea of this project started after working on my Quiz App. I wanted to create another fun experience but with the challenge of something completely different to what I've ever done before: graphics. After carrying out extensive research, it came to my surprise how easy it is to make a game in 3d in React and tools within Three.js.

One of the biggest challenges to this project was the calculations, specifically the positioning in the 3d space. For example: Making a room in position x:0 and z:0 was very simple but when it came to replicating the same room in different locations with different sizes on the canvas, I had issues with doors and walls not being placed connected properly (e.g. some walls sticking out). It took a lot of diagaming to understand the logic properly and came up with some functions to calculate offsets.
